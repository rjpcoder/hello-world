Tutorial


This is the bit where, according to the tutorial, I should write about myself. One thing which is characteristic of myself is that I tend not to like writing too much about myself, save for the fact I don't particularly enjoy writing about myself. If pushed for more information, I would tend to employ such tactics as to write about writing about myself, without actually getting round to any of the writing about myself. Under extreme circumstances, even this does not suffice and a whole new level of meta is thus obtained wherein one can write about the act of writing about writing about oneself whilst simultaneously not getting any of the actual writing about oneself done.
